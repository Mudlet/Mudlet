## Use QLatin1String over QStringLiteral if possible

Some methods in the Qt API have overloads for either taking a QString, or a QLatin1String object.
This is because Latin1 is simpler to parse than UTF-16, and therefore the QLatin1String version can
be faster, and use less memory. This is worth remembering especially for some QString methods:

```cpp
bool same = (str == QLatin1String("Hello"));
str.startsWith(QLatin1String("Hello"));
str += QLatin1String("World");
```

are more efficient than

```cpp
bool same = (str == QStringLiteral("Hello"));
str.startsWith(QStringLiteral("Hello"));
str += QStringLiteral("World");
```

## Do not use ``QStringLiteral("")``

Prefer ``QString()`` over ``QStringLiteral("")`` for  for empty strings - the default constructor 
for QString is cheaper in terms of both instructions and memory.

## Avoid duplicated QStringLiterals

Avoid having multiple QStringLiterals with the same content. For plain literals and QLatin1String, compilers
try to consolidate identical literals so that they are not duplicated. For QStringLiteral, identical strings
cannot be merged.
