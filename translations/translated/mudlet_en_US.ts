</source>
        <comment>This text uses non-breaking spaces (as &apos;%1&apos;s, as Qt Creator cannot handlethem literally in raw strings) and a non-breaking hyphen which are used to prevent the line being split at some places it might otherwise be; when translating please consider at which points the text may be divided to fit onto more than one line. This text is for when TWO or MORE rooms are selected; %1 is the room number for which %2-%4 are the x,y and z coordinates of the room nearest the middle of the selection. This room has the yellow cross-hairs. %n is the count of rooms selected and will ALWAYS be greater than 1 in this situation. It is provided so that non-English translations can select required plural forms as needed.</comment>
        <translatorcomment>The singular case is never used in English as %n is always at least 2.</translatorcomment>

        <translatorcomment>The source text should assume multiple rooms in the first line an area with just one room is not that likely - in this case then the source text will be a duplicate of another one in the same file.</translatorcomment>
