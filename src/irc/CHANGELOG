1.2.1
-----
- Fixed #24: IrcSessionPrivate::_q_error() is too verbose
- Fixed #25: IrcSessionPrivate::processLine() should not respond to
  CTCP requests
- Qt 5 specific build fixes
- Made the default fallback encoding ISO-8859-1
- Fixed a performance bottleneck in IrcDecoder::setEncoding()

1.2.0
-----
- Qt 5 support
- Implemented support for IRC capabilities as specified at
  http://www.leeh.co.uk/draft-mitchell-irc-capabilities-02.html
- Implemented support for the "identify-msg" capability
- Pluginized the message decoder
  - The default message decoder plugin is based on uchardet, which
    is built into the plugin, making it available on all platforms
  - An alternative message decoder plugin based on ICU is available
    in src/plugins/icu must be enabled/built by hand. It requires
    the presence of ICU (modify icu.pri if necessary) that is not
    available for all Communi supported platforms
  - The used message decoder plugin may be controlled by setting the
    COMMUNI_CODEC_PLUGIN (values: uchardet,icu) environment variable
  - In conjuction with the standard QT_PLUGIN_PATH, plugin paths may
    be controlled by setting the COMMUNI_PLUGIN_PATH environment
    variable
- API changes:
  - Added IrcCodecPlugin
  - Added QByteArray IrcMessage::encoding [property]
  - Added IrcMessage::Flags and IrcMessage::flags()
    - None, Own, Identified, Unidentified
