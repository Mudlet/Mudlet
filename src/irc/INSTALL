1. qmake
2. make
3. sudo make install
4. CONFIG += communi
5. enjoy!

Build config
------------
The default build config is resolved by qmake. To build Communi
specifically in release or debug mode, you may pass additional
"-config release" or "-config debug" parameters to qmake, respectively.
Furthermore, in order to build a static version of Communi, you
may pass "-config static".

Example
-------
A static library in release mode:
qmake -config static -config release
