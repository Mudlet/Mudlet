need to sort out single GIT repository for all mudlet code
	(well it's not so bad now ... there is one for lua and one for rest)


Lua Code
	test it properly e.g. that all functions are working
	test new loading
	clean up lua dependences rex_pcre, lpeg, luasql.sqlite3


LuaDoc
	gen LuaDoc and link it from main manual (this will be just API documentation)
		e.g. LuaDoc will replace Alphabetic Function List, but still need most of original doc

	make generated LuaDoc more appealing (check lua/luadoc/doclet/html folder for it)
		this mainly includes better css
