  --- This function creates a stop watch. It is high resolution time
  --- measurement tool. Stop watches can be started, stopped, reset and asked
  --- how much time has passed since the stop watch has been started. Returns
  --- the ID of a high resolution clock with milliseconds to measure time more
  --- accurately than what is possible with std. Lua routines ?
  --- startStopWatch, stopStopWatch, resetStopWatch, getStopWatchTime example:
  --- In a global script you create all stop watches that you need in your
  --- system and store the respective stopWatch-IDs in global variables:
  ---
  --- @return stop watch ID
  ---
  --- @usage
  ---   <pre>
  ---   fightStopWatchID = createStopWatch()
  ---   -- you store the watchID in a global variable to access it from anywhere

  ---   -- To stop the watch and measure its time in e.g. a trigger script you can write:
  ---   fightTime = stopStopWatch(fightStopWatchID)
  ---   echo("The fight lasted for " .. fightTime .. " seconds.")

  --- Deletes the current Line under the user cursor. Note: This is a high speed gagging tool
  --- and it is very good at this task. It is meant to be used when the line can be omitted
  --- entirely in the output. If you want to replace this line with something else have a look
  --- at the replace() functions below. <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- Note that scripts such as: deleteLine(); echo("this line is gone"); will not work because
  --- lines that have been gagged with deleteLine() will not be rendered even if there is text
  --- in the buffer. See wrapLine for details on how to force a re-render if this is necessary
  --- for some reason. This is not the recommended way of replacing text.

  --- Like send(), but without bypassing alias expansion. This function may lead to <b>infinite recursion</b> if
  --- you are not careful! <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- Now, while in Mudlet you can call another alias with the expandAlias() function, this is strongly
  --- discouraged. What you do instead if create a function (for example, send()  and echo()  are functions)
  --- that you can then call from your alias or trigger. This has many advantages - it's faster, you can
  --- easily give your function values, and your function can return you values, too.<br/><br/>
  ---
  --- Note: The variable "command" contains what was entered in the command line or issued via the expandAlias()
  --- function. If you use expandAlias( command ) inside an alias script the command would be doubled. You have
  --- to use send( ) inside an alias script to prevent recursion. This will send the data directly and bypass
  --- the alias expansion.
  ---
  --- @see send

  --- Returns the content of the current line under the user cursor in the
  --- buffer. The Lua variable line holds the content of getCurrentLine()
  --- before any triggers have been run on this line. When triggers change the
  --- content of the buffer, the variable line will not be adjusted and thus
  --- hold an outdated string. line = getCurrentLine() will update line to the
  --- real content of the current buffer. This is important if you want to
  --- copy the current line after it has been changed by some triggers.
  --- selectString( line,1 ) will return false and won't select anything
  --- because line no longer equals getCurrentLine(). Consequently,

  --- The <i>multimatches table</i> is being used by Mudlet in the context of multiline triggers that use Perl regular expression.
  --- It holds the table matches[n] as described above for each Perl regular expression based condition of the multiline trigger.
  --- multimatches[5][4] may hold the 3rd capture group of the 5th regex in the multiline trigger. This way you can examine and
  --- process all relevant data within a single script. <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- What makes multiline triggers really shine is the ability to react to MUD output that is spread over multiple lines
  --- and only fire the action (=run the script) if all conditions have been fulfilled in the specified amount of lines.
  ---
  --- @usage Have a look at this example (can be tested on the MUD batmud.bat.org). <br/>
  --- In the case of a multiline trigger with these 2 Perl regex as conditions:
  ---   <pre>
  ---   ^You have (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+)
  ---   ^You are (\w+).*(\w+).*
  ---   </pre>
  --- The command "score" generates the following output on batMUD:

  --- If you add this script to the trigger:
  ---   <pre>
  ---   showMultimatches()
  ---   </pre>
  --- The script, i.e. the call to the function showMultimatches() generates this output:
  ---   <pre>
  ---   -------------------------------------------------------
  ---   The table multimatches[n][m] contains:
  ---   -------------------------------------------------------
  ---   regex 1 captured: (multimatches[1][1-n])
  ---             key=1 value=You have not completed any quests
  ---             key=2 value=not
  ---             key=3 value=completed
  ---             key=4 value=any
  ---             key=5 value=quests
  ---   regex 2 captured: (multimatches[2][1-n])
  ---             key=1 value=You are refreshed, hungry, very young and brave
  ---             key=2 value=refreshed
  ---             key=3 value=young
  ---             key=4 value=and
  ---             key=5 value=brave
  ---   -------------------------------------------------------
  ---   </pre>
  --- The function showMultimatches() prints out the content of the table multimatches[n][m]. You can now see what the table
  --- multimatches[][] contains in this case. The first trigger condition (=regex 1) got as the first full match
  --- "You have not completed any quests". This is stored in multimatches[1][1] as the value of key=1 in the sub-table matches[1]
  --- which, in turn, is the value of key=1 of the table multimatches[n][m]. <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- Following script would use matched values from previously defined regex in the multiline trigger:
  ---   <pre>
  ---   myGold = myGold + tonumber( multimatches[1][2] )
  ---   mySilver = mySilver + tonumber( multimatches[1][3] )
  ---   </pre>

  --- This function plays a sound file. To make sound work on your operating system you may need to install additional packages: <br/>
  --- Microsoft Windows: The underlying multimedia system is used; only WAVE format sound files are supported. (works out of the box) <br/>
  --- Mac OS X: NSSound is used. All formats that NSSound supports, including QuickTime formats, are supported by Qt for Mac OS X
  --- (should work out of the box). <br/>
  --- X11: The Network Audio System is used if available, otherwise all operations work silently. NAS supports WAVE and AU files. Please use
  --- following workaround for Linux systems:
  ---   <pre>

  --- Raises the event event_name. The event system will call the main
  --- function (the one that is called exactly like the script name) of all
  --- such scripts that have registered event handlers. If an event is raised,
  --- but no event handler scripts have been registered with the event system,
  --- the event is ignored and nothing happens. This is convenient as you can
  --- raise events in your triggers, timers, scripts etc. without having to
  --- care if the actual event handling has been implemented yet - or more
  --- specifically how it is implemented. Your triggers raise an event to tell
  --- the system that they have detected a certain condition to be true or
  --- that a certain event has happened. How - and if - the system is going to
  --- respond to this event is up to the system and your trigger scripts don't
  --- have to care about such details. For small systems it will be more
  --- convenient to use regular function calls instead of events, however, the
  --- more complicated your system will get, the more important events will
  --- become because they help reduce complexity very much. <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- The corresponding event handlers that listen to the events raised with
  --- raiseEvent() need to use the script name as function name and take the
  --- correct number of arguments. NOTE: If you raise an event with 5
  --- arguments but your event handlers functions only take 2,10 or 0
  --- arguments, the functions will not be called. For example:
  --- raiseEvent("fight") a correct event handler function would be:
  --- myScript(event_name). In this example raiseEvent uses minimal arguments, name
  --- the event name. There can only be one event handler function per script,
  --- but a script can still handle multiple events as the first argument is
  --- always the event name. So you can call your own special handlers for
  --- individual events. The reason behind this is that you should rather use
  --- many individual scripts instead of one huge script that has all your
  --- function code etc. Scripts can be organized very well in trees and thus
  --- help reduce complexity on large systems. <br/><br>
  ---
  --- As an example, your prompt trigger could raise an onPrompt event if you want to attach 2 functions to it.
  --- In your prompt trigger, all you'd need to do is raiseEvent("onPrompt") Now we go about creating functions
  --- that attach to the event. Lets say the first one is check_health_stuff() and the other is check_salve_stuff().
  --- We would like these to be executed when the event is raised. So create a script and give it a name of check_health_stuff.
  --- In the Add user defined event handler, type onPrompt, and press enter to add it to the list. In the script box,
  --- create: function check_health_stuff()blah blah end. When the onPrompt event comes along, that script catches it,
  --- and does check_health_stuff() for you. <br/><br/>
  ---
  --- <b>Default events raised by Mudlet</b><br/>
  --- Mudlet itself also creates events for your scripts to hook on. The following events are generated currently:<br/>
  ---
  --- <b><i>sysWindowResizeEvent</i></b><br/>
  --- Raised when the main window is resized, with the new height and width coordinates passed to the event.
  --- A common usecase for this event is to move/resize your UI elements according to the new dimensions.
  --- This sample code will echo whenever a resize happened with the new dimensions:
  ---   <pre>
  ---   function resizeEvent( event, x, y )
  ---      echo("RESIZE EVENT: event="..event.." x="..x.." y="..y.."\n")
  ---   end
  ---   </pre>
  ---
  --- <b><i>sysWindowMousePressEvent</i></b><br/>
  --- Raised when a mouse button is pressed down anywhere on the main window (note that a click is composed of a mouse
  --- press and mouse release). The button number and the x,y coordinates of the click are reported.
  ---   <pre>
  ---   function onClickHandler( event, button, x, y )
  ---      echo("CLICK event:"..event.." button="..button.." x="..x.." y="..y.."\n")
  ---   end
  ---   </pre>
  ---
  --- <b><i>sysWindowMouseReleaseEvent</i></b><br/>
  --- Raised when a mouse button is released after being pressed down anywhere on the main window (note that a click is composed
  --- of a mouse press and mouse release). See sysWindowMousePressEvent for example use.
  ---
  --- <b><i>ATCP events</i></b><br/><br/>
  --- Mudlets ATCP implementation generates events for each message that comes, allowing you to trigger on them easily.
  --- Since ATCP messages vary in name, event names will vary as well. See the atcp section on how to use them.
  function raiseEvent(eventName, ...)
  end

  ---   replace("")
  ---   </pre>
  --- This will effectively have the same result as a call to deleteLine() but the buffer line will not
