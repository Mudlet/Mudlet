--- This returns you the height and the length of letters for the given font size. As the primary intended
--- usage is for calculating the needed dimensions of a miniConsole, it doesn't accept a font argument -
--- as the miniConsoles currently only work with the default font for the sake of portability.
---
--- @usage Get font dimensions in pixes.

--- Copies the current selection to the clipboard. This function operates on rich text, i.e.
--- the selected text including all its format codes like colors, fonts etc. in the clipboard
--- until it gets overwritten by another copy operation. example: This script copies the current
--- line on the main screen to a user window (mini console) named chat and gags the output on
--- the main screen.
---
--- @usage
---   <pre>
---   selectString(line)
---   copy()
---   appendBuffer("chat")
---   replace("This line has been moved to the chat window!")
---   </pre>
---

--- Labels are intended for very small variable or prompt displays or images. labels are clickable and if you specify a callback function with
--- setLabelClickCallback( labelName, myLabelOnClickFunction ) your function will get called if the user clicks on the label with the mouse.
--- If fillBackground = 0, the background will be hidden, if fillBackground = 1 the background will be shown i.e. you can see the background color.
--- labels can be transparent. You can place labels anywhere within then main display, also als overlays over the main displays e.g. for on
--- screen buttons, micro display, etc. DON'T use labels for larger text displays because they are a lot slower than the highspeed mini consoles.
--- <br/><br/>
--- Labels accept some HTML and CSS code for text formating.
---
--- @return true or false
---
--- @usage This example creates a transparent overlay message box to show a big warning message "You are under attack!" in the middle of the screen.
---   Because the background color has a transparency level of 150 (0-255, with 0 being completely transparent and 255 non-transparent) the background
---   text can still be read through. The message box will disappear after 2.3 seconds.
---   <pre>
---   local width, height = getMainWindowSize()
---   createLabel("messageBox",(width/2)-300,(height/2)-100,250,150,1)
---   resizeWindow("messageBox",500,70)
---   moveWindow("messageBox", (width/2)-300,(height/2)-100 )
---   setBackgroundColor("messageBox", 150,100,100,200)
---   echo("messageBox", [[&lt;p style=&quot;font-size:35px&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;You are under attack!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;]] )

--- Opens a console window inside the main window of Mudlet. MiniConsole is openes at position posX/posY with size
--- according to width/height (values depend on your own screen resolution usually between 0-1600 for x and 0-1024
--- for y). This console is the ideal fast colored text display for everything that requires a bit more text e.g.
--- status screens, log windows, chat windows etc.. You can use clearWindow/moveCursor etc. functions for this window
--- for custom printing as well as copy & paste functions for colored text copies from the main window or normal
--- echoUserWindow(name, text) for normal printing. To set word wrap see setWindowWrap. To move the main window to

--- This function creates a stop watch. It is high resolution time
--- measurement tool. Stop watches can be started, stopped, reset and asked
--- how much time has passed since the stop watch has been started. Returns
--- the ID of a high resolution clock with milliseconds to measure time more
--- accurately than what is possible with std. Lua routines ?
--- startStopWatch, stopStopWatch, resetStopWatch, getStopWatchTime example:

--- Deletes the current Line under the user cursor. Note: This is a high speed gagging tool
--- and it is very good at this task. It is meant to be used when the line can be omitted
--- entirely in the output. If you want to replace this line with something else have a look
--- at the replace() functions below. <br/><br/>
---
--- Note that scripts such as: deleteLine(); echo("this line is gone"); will not work because
--- lines that have been gagged with deleteLine() will not be rendered even if there is text
--- in the buffer. See wrapLine for details on how to force a re-render if this is necessary
--- for some reason. This is not the recommended way of replacing text.

--- Disables/deactivates an alias with the given name. This means that when you type in text that should
--- match it's pattern, it won't match and will be sent to the MUD. If several aliases have this name, they'll all be disabled.
function disableAlias(name) end



--- Uses trigger name as id or the id returned by tempTrigger() <b><u>TODO tempKey?</b></u>
function disableKey(name) end



--- Disables a timer from running it's script when it fires - so the timer
--- cycles will still be happening, just no action on them. If you'd like to
--- permanently delete it, use killTimer() instead. <br/><br/>
---
--- Use timer name or the id returned by tempTimer() to identify the timer
--- that you want to disable.
---

--- This function appends text at the end of the current line. The current cursor position is ignored.
--- Use moveCursor() and insertText() if you want to print at a different cursor position. <br/>
--- If the first argument is omitted the main console is used, otherwise the mini console windowName.

---   </pre>
---
--- @param windowName optional window name
--- @param text to display in the echo. Same as a normal echo().

--- @param hint text for the tooltip to be displayed when the mouse is over the link.
--- @param useCurrentFormat true/false - controls whenever the current text formatting (colors, underline, bold, etc)
--- should be used, or the default link format.
---
--- @see setLink
--- @see insertLink
function echoLink(windowName, text, command, hint, useCurrentFormat) end



--- Same as setPopup() except it doesn't require a selection. Method echoPopup creates a link from the given text that it echos.
---
--- @release Mudlet 1.1.0-pre1
---
--- @usage
---   <pre>
---   echoPopup("activities to do", {[[send "sleep"]], [[send "sit"]], [[send "stand"]]}, {"sleep", "sit", "stand"})
---   </pre>
---
--- @see setPopup

--- Enables/activates the alias by it's name. If several aliases have this name, they'll all be enabled.
function enableAlias(name) end



--- Enable key or key group "name" (hot keys or action keys).
function enableKey(name) end



--- Enables or activates a timer that was previously disabled. The parameter
--- "name" expects the timer ID that was returned by tempTimer() on creation
--- of the timer or the name of the timer in case of a GUI timer
function enableTimer(name) end



--- Enables a Trigger. see enableTimer() for more details.
---
--- @see enableTimer
function enableTrigger(name) end



--- Tells you how many things of the given type exist.
---
--- @param type can be "alias", "trigger", or "timer".
---
--- @return number
---
--- @usage
---   <pre>
---   echo("I have " .. exists("my trigger", "trigger") .. " triggers called 'my trigger'!")
---   </pre>
--- @usage You can also use this alias to avoid creating duplicate things, for example:
---   <pre>
---   -- this code doesn't check if an alias already exists and will keep creating new aliases
---   permAlias("Attack", "General", "^aa$", [[send ("kick rat")]])
---
---   -- while this code will make sure that such an alias doesn't exist first
---   -- we do == 0 instead of 'not exists' because 0 is considered true in Lua
---   if exists("Attack", "alias") == 0 then
---       permAlias("Attack", "General", "^aa$", [[send ("kick rat")]])
---   end
---   </pre>
---
--- @see isActive
function exists(name, type) end



--- Like send(), but without bypassing alias expansion. This function may lead to <b>infinite recursion</b> if
--- you are not careful! <br/><br/>
---
--- Now, while in Mudlet you can call another alias with the expandAlias() function, this is strongly
--- discouraged. What you do instead if create a function (for example, send()  and echo()  are functions)
--- that you can then call from your alias or trigger. This has many advantages - it's faster, you can
--- easily give your function values, and your function can return you values, too.<br/><br/>
---
--- Note: The variable "command" contains what was entered in the command line or issued via the expandAlias()
--- function. If you use expandAlias( command ) inside an alias script the command would be doubled. You have
--- to use send( ) inside an alias script to prevent recursion. This will send the data directly and bypass
--- the alias expansion.
---
--- @see send
function expandAlias(command, print=1) end



--- This function will have Mudlet parse the given text as if it came from the MUD - one great application
--- is trigger testing. You can use \n to represent a new line. The function also accept ANSI color codes that
--- are used in MUDs. A sample table can be found here.
---
--- @usage Usage of new line characters.
---   <pre>
---   feedTriggers("\nYou sit yourself down.\n")
---   </pre>

---
--- @see getFgColor

--- This function can be used in checkbox button scripts (2-state buttons) to determine the current state of the checkbox.
---
--- @usage
---   <pre>
---   checked = getButtonStated()
---   if checked == 1 then
---       hideExits()
---   else
---       showExits()
---   end
---   </pre>
---
--- @return numneric state; state = 1 button is checked and state = 0, button is not checked
function getButtonState() end



--- Gets the absolute column number of the current user cursor.
function getColumnNumber() end



--- Returns the content of the current line under the user cursor in the
--- buffer. The Lua variable line holds the content of getCurrentLine()
--- before any triggers have been run on this line. When triggers change the
--- content of the buffer, the variable line will not be adjusted and thus
--- hold an outdated string. line = getCurrentLine() will update line to the
--- real content of the current buffer. This is important if you want to
--- copy the current line after it has been changed by some triggers.
--- selectString( line,1 ) will return false and won't select anything
--- because line no longer equals getCurrentLine(). Consequently,
--- selectString( getCurrentLine(), 1 ) is what you need.
---
--- @usage Update line variable with content of current line.
---   <pre>
---   line = getCurrentLine()
---   </pre>
---
--- @see selectString
function getCurrentLine() end



--- This function returns the RGB values of the color of the first character of the current selection
--- on mini console (window) windowName.

---   local r,g,b
---   selectString("troll", 1)

---   end
---   </pre>
---
--- @see getBgColor
function getFgColor(windowName) end



--- Returns number of the last line in the text buffer.
function getLastLineNumber() end



--- Gets the absolute amount of lines in the current console buffer.
---
--- @return number
function getLineCount() end



--- Gets the absolute line number of the current user cursor.
function getLineNumber() end



--- Returns a Lua table with the content of the lines on a per line basis. Absolute line numbers are used.
---
--- @return section of the content of the screen text buffer. The form of the return value is: Lua_table[relative_linenumber, content]
function getLines(from_line_number, to_line_number) end



--- Return window width and window height (function have two return values). This is useful for calculating the window dimensions and
--- placement of custom GUI toolkit items like labels, buttons, mini consoles etc.
---
--- @usage
---   <pre>
---   mainWindowWidth, mainWindowHeight = getMainWindowSize()
---   </pre>
---
--- @return 2 numbers, width and height in pixels
function getMainWindowSize() end



--- Returns the current home directory of the current profile. This can be used to store data,
--- save statistical information or load resource files.
---
--- @usage Get directory to current profile.

--- Returns the last measured response time between the sent command and the server reply.
---
--- @return number of seconds (0.058 (=58 milliseconds lag) or 0.309 (=309 milliseconds))
function getNetworkLatency() end



--- Returns the time without stoping stop watch (milliseconds based) in form of 0.058
--- (= clock ran for 58 milliseconds before it was stopped).
--- @see createStopWatch

--- The <i>multimatches table</i> is being used by Mudlet in the context of multiline triggers that use Perl regular expression.
--- It holds the table matches[n] as described above for each Perl regular expression based condition of the multiline trigger.
--- multimatches[5][4] may hold the 3rd capture group of the 5th regex in the multiline trigger. This way you can examine and
--- process all relevant data within a single script. <br/><br/>
---
--- What makes multiline triggers really shine is the ability to react to MUD output that is spread over multiple lines
--- and only fire the action (=run the script) if all conditions have been fulfilled in the specified amount of lines.
---
--- @usage Have a look at this example (can be tested on the MUD batmud.bat.org). <br/>
--- In the case of a multiline trigger with these 2 Perl regex as conditions:
---   <pre>
---   ^You have (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+)
---   ^You are (\w+).*(\w+).*
---   </pre>
--- The command "score" generates the following output on batMUD:
---   <pre>
---   You have an almost non-existent ability for avoiding hits.
---   You are irreproachably kind.
---   You have not completed any quests.
---   You are refreshed, hungry, very young and brave.
---   Conquer leads the human race.
---   Hp:295/295 Sp:132/132 Ep:182/181 Exp:269 >
---   </pre>
--- If you add this script to the trigger:
---   <pre>
---   showMultimatches()
---   </pre>
--- The script, i.e. the call to the function showMultimatches() generates this output:
---   <pre>
---   -------------------------------------------------------
---   The table multimatches[n][m] contains:
---   -------------------------------------------------------
---   regex 1 captured: (multimatches[1][1-n])
---             key=1 value=You have not completed any quests
---             key=2 value=not

---             key=2 value=refreshed
---             key=3 value=young
---             key=4 value=and
---             key=5 value=brave
---   -------------------------------------------------------
---   </pre>
--- The function showMultimatches() prints out the content of the table multimatches[n][m]. You can now see what the table
--- multimatches[][] contains in this case. The first trigger condition (=regex 1) got as the first full match
--- "You have not completed any quests". This is stored in multimatches[1][1] as the value of key=1 in the sub-table matches[1]
--- which, in turn, is the value of key=1 of the table multimatches[n][m]. <br/><br/>

--- Raises the event event_name. The event system will call the main
--- function (the one that is called exactly like the script name) of all
--- such scripts that have registered event handlers. If an event is raised,
--- but no event handler scripts have been registered with the event system,
--- the event is ignored and nothing happens. This is convenient as you can
--- raise events in your triggers, timers, scripts etc. without having to
--- care if the actual event handling has been implemented yet - or more
--- specifically how it is implemented. Your triggers raise an event to tell
--- the system that they have detected a certain condition to be true or
--- that a certain event has happened. How - and if - the system is going to
--- respond to this event is up to the system and your trigger scripts don't
--- have to care about such details. For small systems it will be more
--- convenient to use regular function calls instead of events, however, the
--- more complicated your system will get, the more important events will
--- become because they help reduce complexity very much. <br/><br/>
---
--- The corresponding event handlers that listen to the events raised with
--- raiseEvent() need to use the script name as function name and take the
--- correct number of arguments. NOTE: If you raise an event with 5
--- arguments but your event handlers functions only take 2,10 or 0
--- arguments, the functions will not be called. For example:
--- raiseEvent("fight") a correct event handler function would be:
--- myScript(event_name). In this example raiseEvent uses minimal arguments, name
--- the event name. There can only be one event handler function per script,
--- but a script can still handle multiple events as the first argument is
--- always the event name. So you can call your own special handlers for
--- individual events. The reason behind this is that you should rather use
--- many individual scripts instead of one huge script that has all your
--- function code etc. Scripts can be organized very well in trees and thus
--- help reduce complexity on large systems. <br/><br>
---
--- As an example, your prompt trigger could raise an onPrompt event if you want to attach 2 functions to it.
--- In your prompt trigger, all you'd need to do is raiseEvent("onPrompt") Now we go about creating functions
--- that attach to the event. Lets say the first one is check_health_stuff() and the other is check_salve_stuff().
--- We would like these to be executed when the event is raised. So create a script and give it a name of check_health_stuff.
--- In the Add user defined event handler, type onPrompt, and press enter to add it to the list. In the script box,
--- create: function check_health_stuff()blah blah end. When the onPrompt event comes along, that script catches it,
--- and does check_health_stuff() for you. <br/><br/>
---
--- <b>Default events raised by Mudlet</b><br/>
--- Mudlet itself also creates events for your scripts to hook on. The following events are generated currently:<br/>
---
--- <b><i>sysWindowResizeEvent</i></b><br/>
--- Raised when the main window is resized, with the new height and width coordinates passed to the event.
--- A common usecase for this event is to move/resize your UI elements according to the new dimensions.
--- This sample code will echo whenever a resize happened with the new dimensions:
---   <pre>
---   function resizeEvent( event, x, y )
---      echo("RESIZE EVENT: event="..event.." x="..x.." y="..y.."\n")
---   end
---   </pre>
---
--- <b><i>sysWindowMousePressEvent</i></b><br/>
--- Raised when a mouse button is pressed down anywhere on the main window (note that a click is composed of a mouse
--- press and mouse release). The button number and the x,y coordinates of the click are reported.
---   <pre>
---   function onClickHandler( event, button, x, y )
---      echo("CLICK event:"..event.." button="..button.." x="..x.." y="..y.."\n")
---   end
---   </pre>
---
--- <b><i>sysWindowMouseReleaseEvent</i></b><br/>
--- Raised when a mouse button is released after being pressed down anywhere on the main window (note that a click is composed
--- of a mouse press and mouse release). See sysWindowMousePressEvent for example use.
---
--- <b><i>ATCP events</i></b><br/><br/>

--- Since ATCP messages vary in name, event names will vary as well. See the atcp section on how to use them.

---   13 = light cyan
---   14 = dark cyan
---   15 = light white

---   </pre>
---
--- @usage This script will re-highlight all text in blue foreground colors on a black background with a red foreground
---   color on a blue background color until another color in the current line is being met. temporary color triggers
---   do not offer match_all or filter options like the GUI color triggers because this is rarely necessary for scripting.
---   A common usage for temporary color triggers is to schedule actions on the basis of forthcoming text colors
---   in a particular context.
---   <pre>
---   tempColorTrigger(9,2,[[selectString(matches[1],1); fg("red"); bg("blue");]] );
---   </pre>

--- Creates a temporary single shot timer and returns the timer ID for subsequent enableTimer(), disableTimer() and killTimer() calls.
--- You can use 2.3 seconds or 0.45 etc. After it has fired, the timer will be deactivated and killed. <br/><br/>
---
--- Note [[ ]] can be used to quote strings in Lua. The difference to the usual `" " quote syntax is that `[[ ]] also accepts the
---   character ". Consequently, you don't have to escape the " character in the above script. The other advantage is that it can be
---   used as a multiline quote.
---
--- @usage This script will send the command "kill rat" 0.3 seconds after this function has been called. Note that this function
---   does not wait until 0.3 seconds have been passed, but it will start a timer that will run the Lua script that you have provided
---   as a second argument after 0.3 seconds.
---   <pre>
---   tempTimer(0.3, [[send("kill rat")]] )
---   </pre>
---
--- @usage Also note that the Lua code that you provide as an argument is compiled from a string value when the timer fires.
---   This means that if you want to pass any parameters by value e.g. you want to make a function call that uses the value
---   of your variable myGold as a parameter you have to do things like this:
---   <pre>
---   tempTimer(3.8, [[echo("at the time of the tempTimer call I had ]] .. myGold .. [[ gold.")]] )
---   </pre>
---
--- @return timer ID, ID is a string and not a number.
function tempTimer(seconds, luaCode) end



--- This function creates a temporary trigger using substring matching.
--- Contrary to tempTimers, tempTriggers lives throughout the entire session
--- until it is explicitly disabled or killed. Disabled tempTimers can be
--- re-enabled with enableTrigger(). This is much faster than killing the
--- trigger and creating a new one. This is the second fastest trigger (with
--- begin of line substring patterns being the fastest) and should be used
--- instead of regex triggers whenever possible.
---
--- @return trigger ID, ID is a string and not a number.
---
--- @usage You can put the following script into your targeting alias highlight your target. <br/>
---   (Note: trigger will stay active unless you'll kill it.)
---   <pre>
---   target = "rat"
---   if id then
---      killTrigger(id)
---   end
---   id = tempTrigger(target, [[selectString("]] .. target .. [[", 1) fg("gold") resetFormat()]])
---   </pre>
---
--- @see killTrigger
--- @see tempRegexTrigger
function tempTrigger(string, luaCode) end



--- Wait for specified time in milliseconds.
--- <b>Use tempTimer instead! Don't use this function, because it freezes main thread.</b>
---
--- @usage Preferred use of tempTimer - wait for 2 seconds and than send "kill rat".
---   <pre>
---   tempTimer(2, [[send("kill rat")]] )
---   </pre>
--- @usage <b>Discouraged</b> use of wait function.
---   <pre>
---   -- This will freeze Mudlet for 2 seconds!!!
---   wait(2000)
---   send("kill rat")
---   </pre>
--- @usage This example is demonstrating transition from Nexus/Zmud wait.
---   You can simply rewrote following nexus/zmud code bellow with <b>tempTimers</b>.
---   <pre>
---   #send jerk fish
---   #wait 1500
---   #send pull line
---   #wait 500
---   #send jump
---   </pre>
---   Since timers are created instantly, if you want two or more, or means the times
---   for consecutive timers should be to the starting point, unlike relatives times you do with waits.
---   <pre>
---   -- Mudlet code
---   send ("jerk fish")
---   tempTimer (1.5, [[send ("pull line")]])
---   tempTimer (2,   [[send ("jump")]])
---   </pre>
---
--- @see tempTimer
function wait(time) end



--- Wrap line lineNumber of mini console (window) windowName. This function will interpret \n characters,
--- apply word wrap and display the new lines on the screen. This function may be necessary if you use
--- deleteLine() and thus erase the entire current line in the buffer, but you want to do some further
--- echo() calls after calling deleteLine(). You will then need to re-wrap the last line of the buffer
--- to actually see what you have echoed and get you \n interpreted as newline characters properly. <br/><br/>
---
--- Using this function is not good programming practice and should be avoided. There are better ways of
--- handling situations where you would call deleteLine() and echo afterwards e.g.:
---   <pre>
---   selectString(line,1)
---   replace("")
---   </pre>
--- This will effectively have the same result as a call to deleteLine() but the buffer line will not
--- be entirely removed. Consequently, further calls to echo() etc. sort of functions are possible
--- without using wrapLine() unnecessarily.
function wrapLine() end
