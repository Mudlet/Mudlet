### Easy to use client

We’re big on usability, and as such, creating an easy to use client and interface is one of the defining goals of the project. This applies to both the power users and usual gamers – everyone will feel at home with Mudlet, without having to waste too much time figuring out how to do something.

### Designed for speed

Mudlet is designed and built to be very fast and efficient right from the start. Its scripting engine is designed to scale to large systems without bogging down – and the text display is designed to handle thousands of lines in under a second. All in all, we are very serious about Mudlet being quick – and take all measures to make it so.

### Powerful Scripting

Mudlet features a scripting framework using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) – a small, fast and efficient scripting language. This allows Mudlet to leverage the existing community and large ecosystem of existing packages for Lua without the many drawbacks of creating a Mudlet specific scripting language. Best of all, the Lua API is seamlessly integrated in Mudlet and shared by all aliases, triggers, scripts, keybindings, buttons and other Mudlet components.

### Cross-Platform love

We believe in making Mudlet available to people on all major platforms, and we work on keeping cross-platform compatibility right from start. Mudlet is available on Linux (both 32bit and 64bit), Windows, and macOS; you may be able to run it on additional platforms as well.
