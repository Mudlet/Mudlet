Creating OSX installer
----------------------
These instructions are in finished. The gist of it is that you want to install Node.JS, install node-appdmg, and then:

  # clone installers package
  git clone https://github.com/Mudlet/installers.git
  # run script to download, compile and package Mudlet
  ./make-installer.sh

This will save you a nice .dmg to your Desktop, with an aesthetic background and working icons you can drag to install.
