The replay files (recording of input received during a session from a MUD
server) have gained some magic(5) and now have a .mreplay extension.  To permit
some useful data to be extracted from them on the command line by file(1) you
will wish to have this chunk (inside the "=====" delimiters, contains and needs
TAB characters as separators) added to your system /etc/magic file:

=====
0	string	MudletReplayFile\0
>17	byte	>1	Mudlet replay file, version %i
>>18	beqdate	x	\b, started: %s
>>26	beshort	>0	\bi, %i:
>>>28	byte	x	\b%02i:
>>>29	byte	x	\b%02i.
>>>30	beshort	x	\b%03i(h:m:s) long
>>>32	pstring/L	x	\b, profile: "%s"
>>26	beshort	0	
>>>28	byte	>0	\b, %02i:
>>>>29	byte	x	\b%02i.
>>>>30	beshort	x	\b%03i(m:s) long
>>>>32	pstring/L	x	\b, profile: "%s"
>>>28	byte	0	
>>>>29	byte	x	\b, %02i.

Creating OSX installer
----------------------
These instructions are in finished. The gist of it is that you want to install Node.JS, install node-appdmg, and then run the following command after you've command in the src/ directory after you've compiled Mudlet for OSX:

  ./mac-deploy.sh
  appdmg ./osx-installer/mudlet-appdmg.json ~/Desktop/Mudlet.dmg

This will give you a nice .dmg, with an aesthetic background and working icons you can drag to install.
