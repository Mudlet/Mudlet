# Coding guidelines

If you're a first-timer, you're excluded, we'll go easy on you :wink:

## Do not use ``qsl("")``

Prefer ``QString()`` over ``qsl("")`` for  for empty strings - the default constructor
for QString is cheaper in terms of both instructions and memory.

([source](http://blog.qt.io/blog/2014/06/13/qt-weekly-13-qstringliteral/))

## Avoid duplicated qsls

Avoid having multiple qsls with the same content. For plain literals and QLatin1String, compilers
try to consolidate identical literals so that they are not duplicated. For qsl, identical strings
cannot be merged.

## Use .arg(arg1, arg2) instead of .arg(arg1).arg(arg2)

If you just need to use a plain .arg() call, use multiple arguments within it and not as separate .arg() calls as that'll avoid creating temporary QString objects. If your 2nd and 3rd arguments happen to be numbers, be sure to wrap them in  `QString::number(yourNumber)`.

## Naming things? Check against antipatterns

Check https://www.linguistic-antipatterns.com when naming anything to help ensure it can be understood intuitively.

# Internationalization do's and don'ts

Do:
* enable strings visible in the Mudlet GUI to be translateable
* minimise use of HTML styling tags in strings to be translated
* enable users to use language-specific Mudlet object names (triggers, aliases, labels, etc)

Don't:
* translate the Mudlet API: functions, events, error messages or constants (e.g. `main` console)
* use numbers in the API - English words are preferred instead
* try to assemble a sentence on the fly - English grammar does not translate into other languages. Present the full sentence to translators instead
* assume English-centric plural forms, other languages do not necessarily have the simple add an "s"/"es" for more/less then the singular case.
* assume universal quote and number punctuation formats. There are languages that use Â« and Â» instead of " for "quoting" words or phrases. Qt can provide Locale specific displays of numbers/dates/times.

# Tooltip tips:
* Tooltips are (ideally) short pieces of text that can give additional hints or help with a control or setting. As such they are sentences so should end with the appropriate punctuation, usually a period (a.k.a. full-stop).
* To avoid long single line tooltips that sprawl across the screen it is necessary to signal to the Qt libraries that the text is "rich-text", and this is done by the inclusion of HTML-like tags in the text. At a bare minimum this can be done by surrounding the text with a pair of paragraph tags: `<p>`...`</p>`.
* To help with the above there is a static helper functon defined in the `utils` class called `richText(`...`)` that can be put around the text that will insert those tags. As such text is user facing as part of the User Interface (UI) it must be put through the translation system - and thus will likely be inside the `QObject` class's `tr()` method.
* So as to reduce the need for translators to have to deal with HTML-like tags in the texts they have to work on, the `richText` function will eliminate the need for them to remember a pair of `<p>`...`</p>` around a **single** paragraph of text; however when **more** than one paragraph is used it is clearer to NOT use the `utils::richText(`...`)` and include the paragraph tags around each of them. The on-line translation system we use (CrowdIn) can be set to handle/hide HTML tags but it needs to see matched pairs to be able to make sense of them, so:

Do:
  * Single paragraph:
```cpp
    widget->setToolTip(utils::richText(tr("A single sentence or paragraph that is a tool-tip.")));
```

* More than one paragraph:
```cpp
    widget->setToolTip(tr("<p>The first paragraph that is a tool-tip.</p>"
                          "<p>Another paragraph, maybe in a different style, e.g. <i>italics</i> or <b>bold</b>.</p>")));
```

Don't:
  * More than one paragraph:
```cpp
    widget->setToolTip(utils::richText(tr("The first paragraph that is a tool-tip.</p>"
                                          "<p>Another paragraph, maybe in a different style, e.g. <i>italics</i> or <b>bold</b>.")));
```

# TODO's
In Mudlet's decade of existence, TODO's get added to the codebase but almost never resolved. Having them in the codebase does not add any value if they are just sitting there and not acted upon. This raises the question, why have them around at all if they are not adding any value? To this effect, we decided not to add future TODOs to the code and work on removing existing ones.

In case the TODO is an improvement, it's better to add it right away instead of kicking the can down the road. In case it's a legitimate problem, it should be fixed right away also.

# Git commit guidelines for core team

## Refactoring

* Refactors for linting or formatting should be their own PRs
* Do not change code in code paths which are not a part of the PR
  * If it needs to be refactored, it deserves to be its own PR

## Danger enforced PR requirements

* PR Title must start with `fix`, `improve`, `add`, or `infra`
  * This facilitates automatic changelog gathering and categorization
  * Cannot merge until it is fixed: core team can always adjust it before merging
* Any new TODO in a source file must have a Mudlet github issue on the same line
  * good:
    * //TODO: https://github.com/Mudlet/Mudlet/issues/1234
  * bad:
    * //TODO: a thing we aren't actually tracking with an issue

Danger will also give a heads up if the PR title is long, or if more than 10 source files are changed in a single PR. These are not blocked but the warnings should serve to draw attention to something which may require a double check. More info below.

## Mega PRs

Pull Requests that overhaul large pieces of functionality at once will not be accepted: through experience, they bring more pain than they are worth. Being really difficult to discuss, test, and reason about, they are banned.

That does not mean we don't welcome large overhauls: we do. Just make sure to send it in as separate, logically broken-down improvements that implement the functionality you'd like to have in a step process.

Of course, before embarking on such a journey, [discuss with the core team](https://discord.gg/kuYvMQ9) your ideas first so we can guide you on the best design!

## Merging Pull Requests (PRs)

The preferred order of [merging PRs](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-merges/) is:
1. Prefer _squash and merge_ for a clean history and added PR numbers for details of discussion for future comparison.
2. Else _rebase and merge_ if you'd like to keep the history, but know this will not link to the PR in public test builds' (PTB) changelogs, etc.
3. Avoid creating a _merge commit_.

## Merging auto-generated translation PRs

PRs auto-opened by [mudlet-machine-account](https://github.com/mudlet-machine-account) with new translation strings can be approved and merged right away by anyone on the core team.

The idea is to use Crowdin as a single source of truth for translation - if there's an issue with a translation, let's discuss it in Crowdin.
