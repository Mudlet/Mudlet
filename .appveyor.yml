# was QT_BASE_DIR: C:\Qt\5.14.2\mingw73_32 and MINGW_BASE_DIR: C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_32 for old system and no BUILD_BITNESS
# We are not currently using CMake for Windows builds but it might be needed in
# the future - and we now need Q_OR_C_MAKE so as to pull the version number from
# the right project file, MINGW_BASE_DIR is configured automagically :
  - BUILD_PROCESS: Original
    QT_BASE_DIR: C:\Qt\5.14.2\mingw73_32
    MINGW_BASE_DIR: C:\Qt\Tools\mingw730_32
  - BUILD_PROCESS: Replacement
    BUILD_BITNESS: 64
    Q_OR_C_MAKE: qmake
  - BUILD_PROCESS: Replacement
    BUILD_BITNESS: 32
    Q_OR_C_MAKE: qmake

install:
# We try both systems but each one will detect what BUILD_PROCESS is and exit
# early if not selected - we need to do it like that as there is NOT an "if"
# within Appveyor's YAML interpreter
- cd "%APPVEYOR_BUILD_FOLDER%\CI"
- powershell ".\appveyor.install.ps1"
- C:\msys64\usr\bin\sh.exe -c C:\\projects\\mudlet\\CI\\appveyor.install.sh

on_failure:
# This is likely to only work for the Original build process:
- cd C:\src
- powershell "Push-AppveyorArtifact ./verbose_output.log"
- echo "Build failed - see verbose_output.log artifact upload for more information."

# on successful build we may need to use the after_build stage in order to have
# the produced files be made available as a "artifact" - at present it makes
# sure that all the needed files are in the C:\\projects\\mudlet\\package dir:
