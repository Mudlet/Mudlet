HOWTO create an exe-file with an appended zip-resource - file

we assume an imaginary game called "tetris.exe"
1. create a zip-archive "tetris.zip" and store "tetris.exe" with NO COMPRESSION (-e0 option in pkzip)
2. add your data-files, images and sounds to "tetris.zip" with arbitrary compression
3. call "setstub tetris.zip tetris.exe"
4. rename tetris.zip into tetris.exe

now your app should be able read data from itself.
