    \section1 Using the Module

    Using a Qt module requires linking against the module library, either
    directly or through other dependencies. Several build tools have dedicated
    support for this, including \l{CMake Documentation}{CMake} and
    \l{qmake}.

    \section2 Building with CMake

    Use the \c{find_package()} command to locate the needed module components in
    the \c{Qt5} package:

//! [using qt module]


//! [building with qmake]

    \section2 Building with qmake

    To configure the module for building with qmake, add the module as a value
    of the \c QT variable in the project's .pro file:

//! [building with qmake]
