# bitcode (release mode) is incompatible with splitting sections.
# We have to explicitly exclude Xcode, as that supports both debug
# and release builds in the same project. Xcode already has a settting
# for dead code stripping which is enabled by default, so we'll still
# strip any libraries build with split sections.
