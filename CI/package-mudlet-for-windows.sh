# To determine which system libraries have to be copied in it requires

# and adding in the libraries to the same directory and repeating that
# until the executable actually starts to run. Alternatively running
# ntldd ./mudlet.exe | grep "/mingw32" {for the 32 bit case, use "64" for
# the other one} inside an Mingw32 (or 64) shell as appropriate will
# produce the libraries that are likely to be needed below. Unfortunetly
# this process is a little recursive in that you may have to repeat the
# process for individual librarys. For ones used by lua modules this
# can manifest as being unable to "require" the library within lua
