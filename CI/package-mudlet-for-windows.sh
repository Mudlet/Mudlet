# Version: 2.1.0    Remove MINGW32 since upstream no longer supports it
#          2.0.0    Rework to build on an MSYS2 MINGW64 Github workflow
#          1.5.0    Change BUILD_TYPE to BUILD_CONFIG to avoid clash with
#                   CI/CB system using same variable
#          1.4.0    No change
#          1.3.0    Remove used of the no longer supported/used by us QT5
#                   Gamepad stuff (since PR #6787 was merged into
#                   the development branch)
#          1.2.0    No changes
#          1.1.0    Updated to bail out if there isn't a mudlet.exe file to

# To determine which system libraries have to be copied in it requires
# continually trying to run the executable on the target type system
# and adding in the libraries to the same directory and repeating that
# until the executable actually starts to run. Alternatively running
# ntldd ./mudlet.exe | grep "/mingw64" inside an Mingw63 shell as appropriate 
# will produce the libraries that are likely to be needed below. Unfortunately
# this process is a little recursive in that you may have to repeat the
# process for individual librarys. For ones used by lua modules this
# can manifest as being unable to "require" the library within lua
# and doing the above "ntldd" check revealed that, for instance,
# "luasql/sqlite3.dll" needed "libsqlite3-0.dll"!
