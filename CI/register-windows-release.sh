# This script reads the JSON feed for a given GitHub artifact with the given
# BUILD_COMMIT and registers it with dblsqd. It will attempt this for up to
# an hour, every minute until success.
# GHA Env vars needed:
#    ARCH - For registering wither 32 or 64 bit build with dblsqd
#    BUILD_COMMIT - For listing the json feed
#    VERSION_STRING - The version of Mudlet being released

# Exit codes:
# 0 - Everything is fine. 8-)
# 1 - Timeout exceeded, failure
# 2 - ARCH not properly set
# 3 - No release tag argument provided
# 4 - Invalid release tag provided
